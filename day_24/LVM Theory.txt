LVM  [ Logical Volume Manager or Management ]

==============================================================================================

Data Store  <===== DISK <== Partition or Volume  

==============================================================================================

Types of partition OR Volume  Creation concept  ?

1- Standard Partition or Volume ==> Fixed Size ==> 
  We can not Directly Extend or Reduce this Volume Size

2- LVM  ===> We can extend or reduce any space at run time.


==============================================================================================
1- LVM (logical volume manager) is a management technology for storage.

2- LVM technology basically provides the flexible types of
   storage concept where we can easily extend or reduce any volumes size as per deamand.

3- LVM always use in physical datacenters and in cloud based infra. OR Production Server Env.

4- LVM consist by Physical Volumes and Volume groups  .

5- benefits of using LVM, volumes can be reduced or extended easily. 

6- LVM is very flexible to do this with just one command line.

==============================================================================================
Disk  => Partition    ==> Label  ==> DOS OR GPT  ===> save  ==> mkfs  ==>  mount  ==>  /etc/fstab  ==> datas store
Disk  => Partition    ==> Label  ==> DOS OR GPT  ===> save ==> we will not format these partition directly
==============================================================================================
First we will create PV and VG then we will create LV
1- PV create
2- VG Create
3- LV Create
==============================================================================================
4- Format
5- mount
==============================================================================================
   Creation       information read

1- pvcreate   2- pvdisplay  3- pvs 
2- vgcreate   2- vgdisplay  3- vgs
3- lvcreate   2- lvdisplay  3- lvs

4- format   ==> steps will be same
5- mounting ==> also will be same ==>  /etc/fstab 

==============================================================================================
lvextend ==> to extend logical volume from Volume group 
vgextend ==> to extend volume group size using new PV
==============================================================================================
What Is The Difference Between LVM And Standard Partition ?

   Partition sizes can be easily changed with LVM compared to standard partition.
   With LVM, you do not need to unmount a filesystem before resizing,
   it can be done while online.

What is Physical Volume ?

1- physical Volume means a physical partition which comes from the 
   hard drive with 8e hex code.

2- Atleast one PV is required to create any one volume group.


What is Volume group ?

1- Volume groups basically collection of one or more PVs.
2- One Volume group can be devide into a one or more logical volumes.
3- Every LVM's Always depend on the Volume groups.
4- Volume group behave just like as Storage containers.

What is Logical volume  ?

1- LVM basically is a sub part of the Volume group with any defined filesystem Type as per your need.
2- Every LVM can have any types of Filesystem and mounting point.

============================================================================================== 

1- Pvcreation     ==> pvcreate    pvdisplay   pvs
2- Vgcreation     ==> vgcreate    vgdisplay   vgs
3- LV creation    ==> lvcreate    lvdislay    lvs 
4- format         ==> mkfs.type  
5- mount          ==> mount   +  /etc/fstab  
6- testing        ==> data write 

==============================================================================================
What is Extent or block size or chunk size ?
1- PE [ physical extent ]
2- LE [ logical extent  ]

==>> Each physical volume is divided chunks of data, known as physical extents, 
     these extents have the same size as the logical extents for the volume group.


===> logical extent (LE) Each logical volume is split into chunks of data,     
     known as logical extents.

A- The disk space available for allocation in Volume Group is divided into units of
   a fixed-size called extents.

B- An extent is the smallest unit of storage that can be allocated. 
   Within a physical volume, extents are referred to as physical extents.

C- A logical volume is allocated into logical extents of the same size as
   the physical extents.

BY default 1 PE = 4 MB     [ we change , if we require using  -s option in vgcreate ]

Example:-  1 physical Volume  ==> 500 MB 
           1 Volume group     ==> 500 MB /  125 PE

             Logical Volume   ==> 100 MB / 25 LE 

Volume Group  ==> 125 PE  - 25 PE  ==>  100 PE / 400MB  Free Space or Free PE

pvdisplay ==> PE
vgdisplay ==> PE

lvdisplay ==> LE

====== n number of PE ==> volume group  ==> n number PE devides in n number of LEs.
