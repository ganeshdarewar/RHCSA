## Overview

This file provides a comprehensive guide to the concepts of SUDO and SUID in Linux, with practical examples, command outputs, and configuration steps. It is structured as a training resource for Red Hat Linux system administration, focusing on user privilege management and command execution rights.

## SUDO (Super User DO)

### Purpose

- SUDO allows non-root users to execute commands with elevated (root) privileges.
- It is used for both data and command control, enabling fine-grained permission management.

### User Types

- **Super user (root):** Has full rights, prompt is `#`.
- **Normal users:** Limited rights, prompt is `$`, but can be customized via SUDO.

### Locating Commands

- The `which` command is used to find the location of executables (e.g., `which useradd`).

### SUDO Usage

- Normal users can run basic commands, but privileged commands (like `fdisk -l`) require SUDO.
- SUDO rights must be configured in the `/etc/sudoers` file or in files under `/etc/sudoers.d/`.

### SUDOERS File

- Main configuration: `/etc/sudoers`
- User-specific/group-specific: `/etc/sudoers.d/username`
- Syntax allows specifying users, groups, and command restrictions.

### Wheel Group

- The `wheel` group is a special group for users who can run all commands via SUDO.
- Users can be added to the wheel group to grant them SUDO access.

### Examples

- Adding users to the wheel group and verifying their SUDO access.
- Removing users from the wheel group and observing loss of SUDO privileges.
- Checking SUDO permissions with `sudo -l`.

### Custom SUDO Configuration

- Granting specific users or groups access to certain commands.
- Using `NOPASSWD` to allow passwordless execution of specific commands.
- Examples of configuring SUDO for users and groups in `/etc/sudoers` and `/etc/sudoers.d/`.

### Command Aliases

- Defining command aliases (e.g., `NETWORKING`, `STORAGE`) for bulk SUDO rights assignment.
- Assigning these aliases to users for efficient privilege management.

## SUID (Set User ID)

### Purpose

- SUID is a file permission that allows users to execute a file with the permissions of the file owner (usually root).
- Used to grant temporary elevated privileges for specific commands.

### SUID on Commands

- Applying SUID with `chmod u+s /path/to/command` (e.g., `fdisk`, `parted`).
- When SUID is set, any user can execute the command with root privileges.

### Examples

- Setting and removing SUID on commands like `fdisk`, `parted`, `passwd`, and `su`.
- Demonstrating the effect of SUID on command execution for normal users.
- Using `ls -l` to verify SUID status (`rws` instead of `rwx` for the owner).

### ACLs and SUID

- Using `setfacl` to modify access control lists (ACLs) on files.
- Demonstrating how ACLs can override SUID permissions, restricting access even if SUID is set.

### Finding SUID Files

- Using `find / -perm /u=s` to locate all files with the SUID bit set.

## Key Differences: SUDO vs SUID

- **SUDO:** Managed via configuration files, allows controlled and logged privilege escalation for specific users/groups and commands.
- **SUID:** A file-level permission, grants root privileges to anyone executing the file, less granular and less secure than SUDO.

## Practical Scenarios

- Step-by-step creation of users and groups.
- Assigning SUDO rights and testing command execution.
- Applying and removing SUID, observing changes in user capabilities.
- Using command aliases for efficient SUDO management.
- Managing access with ACLs and understanding their interaction with SUID.
